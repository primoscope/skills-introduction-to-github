- Step 3: Open a pull request
- Step 4: Merge your pull request

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Common Issues by Step

#### Step 1: Branch Creation Issues

  3. Type `my-first-branch` in the text box
  4. Click "Create branch: my-first-branch from main"

**‚ùå Problem:** Created branch but still on main
- **‚úÖ Solution:** Switch to your branch
- **How to fix:** Click the branch dropdown and select `my-first-branch`

#### Step 2: File Commit Issues

**‚ùå Problem:** File not found or wrong name

- **How to fix:**
  1. Make sure you're on `my-first-branch`
  2. Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
  3. Type exactly `PROFILE.md` as filename
  4. Add content: `Welcome to my GitHub profile!`

**‚ùå Problem:** File in wrong location
- **‚úÖ Solution:** File must be in the repository root (not in a folder)
- **How to fix:** Don't include any `/` in the filename path

#### Step 4: Merge Issues

**‚ùå Problem:** Merge button is grayed out

## üîß Advanced Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Triggering

If workflows aren't running:

1. **Check Repository Settings:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
   - Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected

2. **Verify Branch Names:**
   - Branch names are case-sensitive
   - Use exactly `my-first-branch` (no extra spaces or characters)

3. **Check File Paths:**
   - `PROFILE.md` must be in repository root
   - File names are case-sensitive

### Starting Over

If you need to reset:

1. **Delete the branch:** Go to repository ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Delete `my-first-branch`
2. **Close pull request:** Go to Pull Requests ‚Üí Close any open PR
3. **Start fresh:** Begin again from Step 1

### Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the Actions tab** to see workflow status
2. **Review your repository structure** - compare with working examples
3. **Read error messages carefully** - they often contain the exact fix needed

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Case sensitivity matters:** `Profile.md` ‚â† `PROFILE.md`
- **Exact names required:** Don't add prefixes or suffixes
- **Wait for feedback:** Give workflows 1-2 minutes to process
- **One step at a time:** Complete each step fully before moving to the next
