## Step 3: Open a pull request

_Nice work making that commit! :sparkles:_

Now that you have made a change to the project and created a commit, itâ€™s time to share your proposed change through a pull request!

**What is a pull request?**: Collaboration happens on a _[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#pull-request)_. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people and allows people to accept, reject, or suggest additional changes to your branch. In a side by side comparison, this pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the `main` project branch. For more information about pull requests, see "[About pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request

You may have noticed after your commit that a message displayed indicating your recent push to your branch and providing a button that says **Compare & pull request**.

To create a pull request automatically, click **Compare & pull request** button, and then skip to step 5 below. Alternately, you practice creating it manually using the first 4 steps.

1. In the header menu of your repository, click the **Pull requests** tab .
2. Click the **New pull request** button.
3. Select the following branches using the dropdown menus.
   
   - **base:** `main`
   - **compare:** `my-first-branch`

4. Click **Create pull request**.

5. Enter a title for your pull request. By default, the title will automatically be the name of your branch. For this exercise, let's edit the field to say `Add my first file`.

6. The next field helps you provide a **description** of the changes you made. Please enter a short description of what youâ€™ve accomplished so far. As a reminder, you have: created a new branch, created a file, and made a commit.
